# Cognitive Science

## Chapter 1: What is Cognitive Psychology?

- The scientific study of how people and animals process information, i.e. acquire, store, retrieve, and use information to achieve goals.

- **History and Approaches**

  - **Greek philosophers**, like Plato and Aristotle, viewed memory as a passive imprint of experiences.
  - **Associationism/empiricism**, advocated by figures like John Locke and David Hume, proposed that all knowledge stems from experience and associations link ideas and memories.
  - **Introspectionism**, led by Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener, aimed to break down complex experiences into basic sensations.
  - **Behaviourism**, championed by James Watson and Edward Thorndike, focused solely on observable behavior and stimuli, rejecting introspection.
  - **Tolman's work**, particularly his research with rats in mazes, challenged behaviourism by suggesting the existence of **mental maps** and **latent learning**.

- **Information Processing: The Cognitive Revolution**

  - The **information processing approach** uses computing as a metaphor for understanding mental activity.
  - **Computer simulations** were developed, including **simulation programs** that aimed to model human thinking and **AI programs** focused on solving problems effectively.
  - Key terms in the information processing account include **mental operations** (inner actions manipulating mental representations) and **internal representations** (mental substitutes for external objects or events).
  - Different types of memory were identified, including **working memory/short-term memory** (a limited store for manipulating information) and **long-term memory** (a vast store of information).

- **Memory**

  - **Short-Term Memory (STM)**, as proposed by Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968), holds information in consciousness temporarily, has limited capacity, and is involved in tasks like language and problem-solving.
  - **Chunking** enables the grouping of related information into units, increasing STM capacity (Miller, 1956).
  - **Baddeley's Working Memory Model**, an alternative to STM, includes components like the **phonological loop** (for speech-based information), the **visuo-spatial sketchpad** (for visual and spatial information), and the **central executive** (which controls attention and information flow).
  - While Baddeley's model offers a useful framework for understanding working memory, it remains vague on certain details.
  - **Squire's Taxonomy of Long-Term Memory** classifies different types of long-term memories.

- **Cognitive Capacity/Architecture**

  - Cognitive capacity refers to the brain's capabilities, which are largely innate but can be influenced by factors like maturation and practice.
  - Combined with knowledge, cognitive capacity shapes our actions.

- **A Language Example and Cognitive Penetrability**

  - Cognitive penetrability examines how knowledge and context can influence seemingly basic cognitive processes, like pronoun reference assignment.

- **What is a Mental Representation?**

  - **Mental representations**, which are images or verbal concepts of external reality, are crucial for psychological explanation, though their exact nature is debated.
  - Common components include the represented world (the domain being represented), the representing world (where representations reside), representing rules (mapping between the two worlds), and the process that utilizes the representation.
  - Representations inherently lose information about the represented world.

- **Two Sorts of Representations**

  - **Analog representations** depict a continuous quantity with another continuous quantity, mirroring the structure of the represented world.
  - **Symbolic representations**, like numerals, use arbitrary symbols linked to abstract quantities through representing rules.

- **Dan Williams (2018)**

  - Williams defines mental representations as brain structures that function like external representations (maps, models, etc.).

- **Computer Simulation**

  - **General Problem Solver**, one of the first simulation models, could solve problems like logic tasks using **means-ends analysis** (breaking down problems into goals and subgoals).
  - **ACT-R** (Anderson, 2004) is a series of models culminating in a detailed model of human cognition.
  - ACT-R distinguishes between **declarative knowledge** (consciously accessible facts and rules) and **procedural knowledge** (unconscious, automatic procedures).
  - **Skill acquisition** involves **knowledge compilation**, which transforms declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge through **proceduralization** (creating production rules) and **composition** (pruning unnecessary productions).
  - **Connectionism** simulates learning and perception through networks of interconnected units, modified by learning rules.
  - **Distributed representations** use multiple units to represent concepts, offering efficiency and solving the combinatorial explosion problem.
  - Different types of connectionist networks include **feedforward networks** (information flows in one direction) and **recurrent networks** (connections feed back to earlier layers).

- **Some Terms**

  - **Artificial intelligence (AI)** encompasses machines performing tasks considered "smart."
  - **True AI** refers to human-level AI that understands and interacts with the world like humans.
  - **GOFAI (good old-fashioned AI)** utilizes symbolic techniques to encode problem models and process data.

- **Functional Level of Analysis**

  - The **information processing approach** focuses on mental software and the strategies employed in information processing.
  - While the **strong functionalist view** posits that the brain's physical nature is irrelevant to functional analysis, modern cognitive scientists acknowledge the importance of considering all levels of analysis.

- **The Tri-Level Hypothesis**

  - This hypothesis proposes that intelligent systems are organized at three levels: physical/biological, symbolic/syntactic, and knowledge/semantic.
  - These levels correspond to different aspects of explaining a system's behavior.
  - While cognitive science primarily focuses on the functional levels (syntactic and semantic), the biological/physical level is increasingly recognized as important.

- **Cognitive Neuroscience**

  - Cognitive neuroscience studies the neural and biological processes underlying cognition.
  - The brain, the central part of the nervous system, is highly structured with distinct regions specializing in different functions.

- **A Neuron**

  - The **neuron** is the fundamental building block of the brain.
  - Key components include the **cell body**, **dendrites** (receive signals), and **axon** (transmits signals).
  - Neurons communicate through **synapses** (gaps between neurons) via chemical messengers called **neurotransmitters**.

- **Cognitive Neuropsychology**

  - Cognitive neuropsychology investigates the relationship between brain function and cognition through the study of brain damage.
  - The **localization** or **modularity hypothesis** proposes that specific mental functions are tied to particular brain areas.
  - The **distributed view**, in contrast, suggests that complex functions are dispersed throughout the brain.
  - **Double dissociations**, where two patients with different brain injuries show opposite patterns of impairment, provide evidence for the modularity of certain functions.

- **What is a Mental Module?**

  - Mental modules are domain-specific mental structures invoked to explain cognitive capacities.
  - Two main types exist: **Chomskian modules** (systems of mental representations) and **computational modules** (domain-specific computational devices).
  - **Evolutionary psychology** proposes that the mind is largely or entirely composed of **Darwinian modules**, while Fodor argues for **peripheral modularity**.
  - Arguments for **massive modularity** draw on the principle of functional specialization and the analogy of organs in the body.

- **Brain Imaging**
  - **Structural imaging** shows the brain's anatomy, while **functional imaging** depicts brain activity.
  - **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** is the dominant method for structural imaging, while **functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)** is favored for functional imaging due to its good temporal and spatial resolution.
  - **Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)** uses magnetic pulses to stimulate or inhibit brain activity, allowing researchers to investigate the causal role of specific brain areas.

## Chapter 2: Perception (Visual)

- **Overview**

  - This chapter covers general concepts in visual perception, eye movements (especially in reading), and the interplay between bottom-up and top-down processes.

- **Introduction: Sensing the World**

  - Our perceptual systems have evolved to identify relevant changes in the constantly shifting environment.
  - Humans perceive the world through various sensory systems, including vision, audition, taste, smell, touch, equilibrioception, thermoception, and nociception.

- **Sensation vs. Perception**

  - Perception involves more than just conscious awareness; it encompasses numerous unconscious processes.
  - **Visual agnosia** (impaired object recognition) and **prosopagnosia** (impaired face recognition) demonstrate the distinction between sensation and perception.
  - **Hemineglect**, a condition where individuals fail to attend to one side of space, further highlights the interpretive role of perception.

- **The Eye**

  - The eye focuses light onto the **retina**, which contains **rods** (sensitive to light) and **cones** (detect color).
  - The **fovea**, located in the center of the retina, has the highest concentration of cones and provides the sharpest vision.
  - **Visual acuity** is greatest in the fovea and declines towards the periphery.
  - Eye movements, including **saccades** (rapid, jerky movements) and **fixations** (periods of relative stillness), allow the visual system to sample information from the environment and focus it on the fovea.

- **Visual Information Processing**

  - Visual information from the retina is transmitted through the **lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)** to the **visual cortex** at the back of the brain.
  - The visual cortex is organized **retinotopically**, meaning that adjacent areas in the visual field are represented by adjacent areas in the cortex.
  - Two main pathways in the visual system: the **ventral stream** (the "what" pathway, involved in object recognition) and the **dorsal stream** (the "where" pathway, involved in spatial processing).

- **Eye Movements (and Reading)**

  - **Fixations** are periods of relative stillness during which information is extracted from the visual scene.
  - **Saccades** are rapid, ballistic eye movements used to locate targets on the fovea.
  - **Pursuit eye movements** track moving objects.
  - The combination of fixations and saccades creates a series of snapshots that must be integrated by the visual system.
  - Eye movements can be measured using various techniques, including **dual Purkinje eye trackers**, **head-mounted eye trackers**, and **remote eye movement tracking equipment**.

- **Eye Movement Control during Reading**

  - Reading involves a complex interplay of fixations and saccades, with readers typically fixating on content words and skipping function words.
  - The **perceptual span** refers to the amount of information taken in during a single fixation.
  - Studies using the **moving window paradigm** have revealed the size and characteristics of the perceptual span.
  - Reading speed and comprehension are influenced by factors like word frequency, word length, and the presence of regressions (backward eye movements).

- **Eye Movement Control during Reading: Theories**

  - **Occulomotor models** propose that eye movements during reading are primarily driven by low-level visual features of the text.
  - **Processing models** emphasize the role of cognitive factors, such as lexical processing and comprehension processes, in guiding eye movements.

- **Bottom-Up and Top-Down Processes**

  - **Bottom-up processing** (stimulus-driven) starts with sensory information and progresses to higher-level conceptual processing.
  - **Top-down processing** (concept-driven) utilizes context, expectations, and knowledge to influence perception.
  - The visual system constantly constructs and tests hypotheses about the environment, balancing stability and plasticity.

- **Evidence for Interaction: Multistable Figures**

  - **Multistable figures**, such as the Necker cube, demonstrate the dynamic interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes.
  - The spontaneous reversals in perception of these figures suggest that the brain continuously generates and adopts different hypotheses consistent with the ambiguous visual input.
  - Eye movement patterns during the perception of multistable figures are correlated with the adopted perceptual hypothesis.

- **Other Evidence: Ambiguous Concealed Figures and Impossible Figures**

  - Changes in eye movements following the recognition of concealed figures provide evidence for the role of top-down, schema-driven processes.
  - **Impossible figures**, like the Devil's fork and the Impossible triangle, highlight the brain's struggle to integrate contradictory perceptual cues.

- **Bottom-Up and Top-Down Processes in Perception**

  - The interaction between bottom-up and top-down processes is essential for explaining perceptual phenomena.
  - Studies have shown that emotionally salient information is processed more rapidly and can influence mid-level visual processing.

- **Marr's (1982) Theory**

  - Marr's computational model of object recognition proposes three bottom-up stages:
    - **Primal sketch**: Identifying contours, edges, and surfaces from a gray-scale representation, guided by **Gestalt principles** (proximity, similarity, closure, etc.).
    - **2.5D sketch**: Incorporating the third dimension (depth) through a range map that specifies distance and angle from the viewer's perspective.
    - **3D model representation**: Matching the target object with an internal representation, moving from a view-dependent to a view-independent representation.

- **Recognition**

  - **Template matching** involves comparing the perceived object to a stored template, but it struggles with the vast variability in object shapes.
  - **Feature analysis** deconstructs objects into component features that can be compared with a library of features.
  - **Prototype theory** suggests that we categorize objects by comparing them to the most typical example (prototype) of a category.
  - **Viewpoint invariant relationships** are crucial for object recognition, as they remain consistent regardless of viewing angle.
  - **Biederman's Recognition by Components (RBC) theory** proposes that objects are composed of **geons**, volumetric primitives that can be recognized from any viewpoint.

RBC Theory Limitations:

- Relies on predefined geometric primitives (geons)
- Uses a rigid, hand-crafted feature approach
- Assumes a fixed, universal "shape alphabet"

Deep Learning (CNN) Advantages:

- Learns features hierarchically and dynamically
- Extracts representations directly from data
- Demonstrates superior performance on recognition tasks
- Suggests a more flexible, adaptive model of visual perception

The success of CNNs implies that visual recognition might be more about learned, adaptive feature extraction than a predetermined set of shape components. This challenges the RBC theory's fundamental assumption about how we recognize and categorize visual information.

The neural network approach more closely mimics the brain's apparent plasticity, where visual representations emerge through learning rather than being pre-programmed. This perspective aligns with contemporary neuroscientific understanding of perceptual processing as a dynamic, hierarchical phenomenon.

- **Object Recognition**

  - Current research suggests that both view-independent and view-dependent properties contribute to object recognition.
  - Shape plays a primary role in object recognition, while color and other features become more important when shape information is ambiguous.
  - Studies on **word- and object-superiority** demonstrate the influence of top-down processing on perception.

- **Scenes**

  - Scene perception involves processing an entire environment, building on principles of object recognition.
  - Humans rapidly process visual scenes, demonstrating **scene-superiority** in tasks like object identification.

- **Perception of Biological Motion**
  - Humans are highly attuned to biological motion, able to recognize identity, gender, emotion, and actions from minimal visual cues.
  - While **mirror neurons** have been proposed as a neural basis for understanding actions, their role in perception and cognition remains a subject of debate.

Mirror neurons affect a person’s ability to learn via imitation, therefore their malfunction inhibits one’s learning of motor functions from visual cues. In terms of social interaction, mirror neurons allow for a recognition of the motives behind other people’s actions, therefore their malfunction makes it difficult to understand the underlying motivations behind people’s behaviour.

## Chapter 3: Reasoning and Decision Making

- **Introduction**

  - This chapter explores two key areas of cognitive processes: **deduction** (drawing logical inferences from premises) and **decision making** (choosing between alternative options).

- **Deduction**

  - **Deductive reasoning** involves drawing conclusions that necessarily follow from given premises, as opposed to **induction**, which extends beyond the information in the premises.

- **Mental Logic**

  - The **mental logic** theory suggests that people reason by translating problems into abstract logical structures and applying syntactic rules.
  - However, people's reasoning doesn't always align with formal logic, as evident in errors and difficulty with certain rules like **modus tollens**.
  - The **Wason Selection Task**, a classic reasoning problem, demonstrates the influence of content on performance, with abstract versions proving more challenging than concrete ones.

- **Mental Models**

  - The **mental model theory** posits that people reason by constructing mental simulations of the possibilities described in the premises.
  - The difficulty of a problem is related to the number and complexity of mental models required.
  - **Spatial reasoning** involves reasoning about spatial relationships between objects or events.
  - The mental model account of spatial reasoning predicts difficulty based on the number of models needed, while the mental logic account focuses on the application of inference rules.
  - Computational models of spatial reasoning, such as **PRISM** (Ragni & Knauff, 2013), aim to simulate the processes of model construction and manipulation.
  - **Syllogisms** are a type of logical argument consisting of two premises and a conclusion.
  - The mental model theory explains syllogistic reasoning by positing that people construct models of the premises and evaluate the conclusion against those models.
  - The number of models required influences difficulty, and content effects can arise during model construction and validation.

- **Dual Process Theories**

  - **Dual process theories** propose two distinct cognitive systems: **System 1** (fast, intuitive, heuristic-based) and **System 2** (slow, analytical, rule-based).
  - The **belief-bias effect**, where people's judgments are influenced by the believability of a conclusion, exemplifies the interaction between these systems.
  - Dual process theories account for performance on tasks like the Wason Selection Task by attributing differences in performance to the engagement of different systems.
  - While System 2 is involved in logical reasoning, System 1 can lead to biases like the **matching bias** (selecting options mentioned in the rule).
  - The dual process framework and the mental model theory are not incompatible; they can be seen as complementary accounts of reasoning.

My understanding is that one of the key roles of System 2 is to override the impulsive responses generated by System 1, which are often shaped by cognitive shortcuts, such as biases and heuristics. System 2 can, at least in certain situations, counteract these tendencies by engaging in more deliberate and reflective thinking. However, I believe that completely eliminating biases is neither realistic nor desirable. Biases and heuristics serve an important purpose: they enable us to make decisions quickly and efficiently in many situations where speed is critical. They exist for a reason.

- **Decision Making**

  - **Decision making** involves choosing between alternative options, often with the aim of maximizing **subjective expected utility (SEU)**, which represents the perceived value of an outcome.
  - While **normative approaches** prescribe the optimal decision-making process, **descriptive approaches** focus on how people actually make decisions, which often involve **biases** (systematic deviations from rationality).

- **Some DM-Problems**

  - Research in decision making explores situations where people's judgments deviate from rational norms, such as problems involving choices under uncertainty or probability estimation.

- **Availability Heuristic**

  - The **availability heuristic** involves estimating frequency or probability based on the ease with which relevant instances come to mind.

- **Base-Rate Neglect: Lawyers vs. Engineers Problem**

  - The **lawyers vs. engineers problem** demonstrates **base-rate neglect**, the tendency to ignore prior probabilities when making judgments.
  - This bias can be explained by the **representativeness heuristic**, where people judge likelihood based on similarity to a stereotype, even when base rates contradict that judgment.

- **Representativeness Heuristic**

  - The **representativeness heuristic** involves judging the probability of an event based on its similarity to a prototype or model, often leading to neglect of base rates and other statistical information.

- **Anchoring**

  - **Anchoring** occurs when judgments are influenced by an initial value (anchor), even if that value is arbitrary or irrelevant.

- **Some Theoretical Frameworks**

  - **Prospect theory** proposes that people's decisions are influenced by the framing of outcomes and their subjective perception of probabilities, which often deviates from objective values.

- **Two-System Approaches to Decision Making**

  - The two systems framework can be applied to decision making, with System 2 involved in analytical decisions and System 1 responsible for heuristic-driven, intuitive judgments.

- **Fast and Frugal Heuristics: The Adaptive Toolbox**

  - **Fast and frugal heuristics** are simple, efficient strategies that rely on a limited number of cues to make decisions.
  - An example is the **gaze heuristic**, used in tasks like catching a ball, which ignores complex calculations and focuses on a single cue (keeping the angle of gaze constant).

- **The Recognition Heuristic**

  - The **recognition heuristic** dictates choosing the recognized option when comparing two options, assuming that recognition is correlated with other desirable attributes.
  - Studies have shown that the recognition heuristic can be surprisingly accurate in certain domains, demonstrating the adaptive value of simple heuristics.

- **The Take-the-Best Heuristic**

  - The **take-the-best heuristic** involves sequentially evaluating cues in order of their validity and choosing the option favored by the first discriminating cue encountered.
  - This heuristic exemplifies **one-reason decision making**, where a single cue determines the choice.

- **Fast-and-Frugal Trees**

  - **Fast-and-frugal trees** are decision trees that use a limited set of cues to classify objects or make decisions.
  - They have been shown to be surprisingly accurate in various domains, including medical diagnosis and legal decision making.

- **Conclusion**
  - Research has challenged the view of heuristics as inherently faulty shortcuts, demonstrating their effectiveness in certain contexts.
  - Understanding the conditions under which specific heuristics succeed can enable us to teach them effectively and improve decision making in various domains.

## Chapter 4: Language

- **Introduction**

  - This chapter explores the structure of language, language acquisition, and the relationship between language and thought.

- **Language and Sounds**

  - **Phones** are basic speech sounds.
  - **Phonemes** are the smallest meaning-distinguishing sound units in a language.
  - **Allophones** are phonetic variants of the same phoneme.
  - **Phonotactic rules** govern the permissible sound combinations in a language.

- **Language and Communication**

  - Language allows for the transmission of complex ideas, social information, and information about abstract concepts.
  - Human languages are **generative** (capable of producing infinite sentences) and **structure-dependent** (relying on syntactic rules).

- **The Eight Parts of Speech**

  - Traditional grammar classifies words into eight parts of speech: noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.

- **Hockett's Design Features for Human Language**

  - Charles Hockett proposed sixteen **design features** that characterize human language, distinguishing it from other communication systems.
  - These features include vocal-auditory channel, broadcast transmission, rapid fading, interchangeability, feedback, specialization, semanticity, arbitrariness, discreteness, displacement, productivity, cultural transmission, duality of patterning, prevarication, reflexiveness, and learnability.

- **Our Advantage: Ability to Transmit...**

  - Language allows humans to convey vast amounts of information about the world, social relationships, and abstract concepts that don't physically exist.
  - This capacity has enabled large-scale cooperation, cultural transmission, and rapid innovation.

- **Language Acquisition**

  - A central question in language acquisition is the role of innate mechanisms versus experience.
  - Infants progress from babbling to one-word utterances, gradually acquiring vocabulary and grammatical structures.
  - Studies suggest that infants develop an understanding of word meanings and relationships between concepts before they can speak.
  - Early vocabulary often includes words for objects frequently encountered in the infant's environment.
  - **Morphemes** are the smallest units of meaning within words, and their acquisition reflects the development of grammatical understanding.
  - By age 3-4, children typically produce grammatically correct sentences.

- **The Acquisition of Syntactic Categories**

  - Children's ability to acquire complex grammatical structures raises questions about the nature of innate linguistic knowledge.
  - The distinction between **lexical verbs** (main verbs) and **auxiliary verbs** (helping verbs) has been studied to investigate the innateness of grammatical categories.
  - The **functional/lexical distinction** may be a candidate for an innate linguistic category, as it appears in all languages and helps explain patterns of language acquisition.

- **Transformational Grammar of Chomsky**

  - **Chomsky's transformational grammar** has evolved through various iterations, aiming to explain the underlying structure of human language.
  - Early versions proposed a universal grammar based on noun and verb phrases, but later revisions acknowledged the diversity of linguistic structures across languages.

- **What about Words and their Meaning?**

  - Research has found cross-linguistic similarities in the sounds used to describe basic concepts, suggesting a possible link between sound and meaning.

- **A Critical Period?**

  - The existence of a **critical period** for language acquisition is debated, with evidence from **deaf isolates** and **second language learning** providing insights.
  - While early exposure to language is beneficial, the decline in language learning ability with age may be gradual rather than abrupt, suggesting a **sensitive period** rather than a strict critical period.
  - Alternative explanations for age-related differences in language learning include the **"less is more" hypothesis** and the **dominant language switch hypothesis**.

- **Grice's Logic of Conversation**

  - **Grice's theory of conversational implicature** explains how we infer meaning beyond the literal words spoken.
  - He proposed that conversation follows a **cooperative principle**, with speakers adhering to **maxims** of quality (truthfulness), quantity (informativeness), manner (clarity), and relevance.

- **Other Gaps between Words and the Intended Meaning & the Importance of Context**

  - Communication relies on shared context and inferences to bridge gaps between literal meaning and intended meaning.
  - **Indexicals**, **background knowledge**, **unarticulated constituents**, **multiple meanings**, and **underspecificity** all contribute to the need for interpretation in conversation.

- **Grice's Cooperative Principle**

  - The cooperative principle states that speakers should make their contributions relevant, informative, clear, and truthful, facilitating effective communication.

- **Not Following the Maxims...**
  - Speakers can intentionally **violate** (mislead), **opt out** of (refuse to cooperate), or **flout** (be ironic) maxims, creating specific communicative effects.
  - Flouting a maxim involves deliberately breaking a rule while still signaling cooperation, prompting the listener to infer the intended meaning.
