   - Minimisation of FSM
   - Determinisation of NDFSM
   - Regular expressions, regular sets, relationship between regular expressions and FSM
   - Kleene algebra

2. **Information Theory**

3. **Computability Theory**

   - Solubility and insolubility (Halting problem, Post's correspondence problem)
   - Non-deterministic Turing machines, other Turing machine variants, and their equivalence
   - Universal Turing Machine, Beyond Turing-computability.

4. **Complexity Theory**

   - Analysis of algorithms and complexity theory
   - The classes P and NP, the class NP-complete
   - Space complexity classes
   - Information complexity

5. **Graph Theory**

   - Motivating problems
   - Basic deﬁnitions: connectednessm digraphs, graph isomorphisms and matrix representations
   - Search in graphs
   - Spanning trees and minimum spanning trees, the shortest route problem
   - Eulerian paths and applications, Euler's theorem
